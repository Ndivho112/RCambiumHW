#instruction file for CAMBIUM
#replaces some switches and inputs that used to be done through the user interface of the pascal code.

  [TODO] describe this in the documentation/introduction to the package, refer to publication, too.
Menu_PhysOptions_WaterStressShape = 1 # 1= linear effect of water stress.  other =  nonlinear as option.
  [TODO] Menu_PhysOptions_AuxSens = 0
  [TODO] duration of secondary thickening (set at time of onset) = ONOFF -> def. 0
  [TODO] cumulative temperature 5 default
  [TODO] minsize cell wall thickening = 1
  [TODO] RunningMeanDurationFoliage as parameter -
  override vessel formation - parameter
  [TODO] form_RadialFiles$TrackBar_RadialCellFiles$Position must be a new specifier
  [TODO] form_RadialFiles$TrackBar_RadialCellFiles$Position- now called TrackBar_RadialCellFiles_Position
  [TODO] Menu_Options_StartSizeVariation.Checked - now called StartSizeVariation - (TRUE FALSE) switch to enable somewhat random sizes
  [TODO] Form_SegmentOptions.edit_SegmentLengthFibres.text  now called SegmentLengthFibres
  could create an "instruction file" with these options - or pass them on as object already into R.
   calculate modifiers uses an input from Form_CumulativeTemperature.TrackBar_CumTempDuration


  change segment length
  #DONE: specify limits for cell interactions --
  form_MaxInterCellAdjust.CB_InterCellAdjustmentAnchor.Checked ?
  menu_PhysOptions_XMCCrush$checked


  ----
  number of radial cell file ( must make sure minimum number to make cells form)
  #DONE: Maximum intercell radial adjustment 0, 8, 20 mum
  anchor growth of faster growing cell files (default: no)
  [TODO] which I now call CumTempDuration and the user has to specify it somewhere else- maybe at input or in the instruction file ( if we go down this route.)
  [TODO] use instruction file values later to sanity-check ranges.
  [TODO] in auxFunctions.R form_calculationmethods$RG_AuxinConcChangeMethod$ItemIndex  -> AuxinConcChangeMethod can be 0 or 1- what does it mean
  ThickeningDurationControl 0 or nonzero.
  SecThickDur Menu_PhysOptions_SecThickDur$Checked  needs TRUE OR FALSE
  MinSizeSecThickSet  Menu_PhysOptions_MinSizeSecThick$Checked
  GrowthPhaseMinSize menu_PhysOptions_GrowthPhaseMinSize$Checked
