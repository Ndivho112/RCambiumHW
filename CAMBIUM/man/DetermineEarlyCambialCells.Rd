\description{
Determines the identity of all cells in the cambium at initialization.
}
\details{
This function iterates through each cell and determines its identity based on the cell type and radial position.
If the cell is a fusiform initial or cambial initial, its identity is determined as either phloem mother cell or xylem mother cell, depending on the radial position.
If the cell is a ray initial, its identity is determined as either ray initial (primary) or ray initial (xylem), depending on the radial position.
The meristematic status of all cells is set to "MERISTEMATIC" and the differentiation status is set to "GROWING".
